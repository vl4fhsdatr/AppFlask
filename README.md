# App Flask

`App Flask` is an Android application which manages unused apps. With `App Flask`, you can put these apps into the flask (i.e. disable them). A brief explanation can be found in [this post](https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/56620/enable-and-disable-system-apps-via-adb).

## Warning

**This app will be executed with superuser privilege, which may be harmful to your device.**
